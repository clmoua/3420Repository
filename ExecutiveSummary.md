# Executive Summary

###Problem
The problem our system will try to solve is that the intake of external sources carries risks.
Risks from external source include not having much support from a community, infringement on someone's intellectual property,
reliablity, and the security of the source (OpenLogic, 2013). If the risks are not dealt with there will be negative repercussions that can
harm the organization. Negative repercussions include wasting resources such as time and money. It also includes not 
having support from the group that will help improve on the external source.

###Solution
To respond to or alleviate the risks we will create a system than can help identify the risks or vulnerabilities. 
This system will be able to get access to information from the NIST database. We will use that information from the
NIST database and compare it to our policy document. If the results from the NIST databases passes the allowable results in 
our policy then the external source will be used. If the result does not pass then the external source will
not be used.
